    <h3 class="darkRed">A Short Story of the Longest Night</h3>
      <p class="navyBlue"> The pandemic begins.</p>
    <p class="navyBlue"> Weak and strained, a cough fills the empty air. As soon as sleep sets in, my lungs stop and my slow pulse fades away. Sit up. <br>
        <span>I can't breathe. </span> In. Out. In. I can't sleep. I'll die. Another hour slips away leaned against a wall, forcing every breath. <br>
        Just breathe. I won't go tonight. Should I write a letter? There's too much to say... I won't go tonight. In. Out. In. <br>
        'Am I cold? I'm drenched. I need to sleep.' Slow and encumbered, I slip down again. There is no up, no down. I've lost my sense <br>
        of space. Slowly gliding in a void, my mind loses it's hold. Heart rate plummeting, a burst of adrenaline reminds me to live <br>
        again. <span>This is the last night of my life.</span> I need water. Get up, eyes open. I can hardly walk. Every shadow looms and lunges. <br>
        The wavering penumbra of my sight is frantic; the collapsing periphery of my mind is the thin barrier of hell. </p>
    <p class="navyBlue"> 3:27am. 105. 4 pills. A numbing conflagration. How long have a been here? The room turns itself, and the world disavows my pitiful <br>
      perspective. The floor becomes a wall. Effortlessly, I am affixed. Left, laundry defies gravity. Right, a crooked door. Below, <br>
      a pouring sink surrenders orientation. Ahead, a bulb blares and a fan groans.</p>
    <p class="navyBlue">The light of the bathroom consumes the world. I'm alone, engulfed by my opposition. </p>
    <p class="navyBlue"> Am I <br>
          breathing? </p>
    <p class="navyBlue"> Where am I? </p>
    <p class="navyBlue"> My legs finally move. Dawn. The faint blue light whispers through the blinds. My chest flickers on it's own again. </p>
